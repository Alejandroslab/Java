You can download it from jdk.java.net/18/

Extract the file and move to
C:\Programs\Java
If you don't have the Java folder you can create one

Inside Java you should see now the extracted folder called something like 'jdk-18'
Inside 'jdk-18' you will find some folders and also a 'bin' one

After that you should set your java inside your PATH
This means that you must indicate this new path

C:\Programs\Java\jdk-18\bin

inside your PATH variable

To do that in start you must open the 'Environment Variables'
Below in 'System variables' you will find the variable: 'Path' and maybe 'JAVA_HOME'

Now double click on 'Path' click add and paste the previous path:

C:\Programs\Java\jdk-18\bin

Click Ok

Now if you don't have the 'JAVA_HOME' variable you can create it clicking on 'New'
under 'Variable Name' type: 'JAVA_HOME' without the apostrophe
under 'Value Variable' type the path BUT without the '\bin':

C:\Programs\Java\jdk-18

Click ok

Now click ok again and close your 'Environment variables'

DONE!
Now any program with java should work on your machine
